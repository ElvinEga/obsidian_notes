The response A is the correct one. It has a function named reverse_number that takes an integer value as an argument. This function uses a slicing operation to reverse the sequence of digits in the integer and returns the reversed value. The function is then called in a print function, which outputs the correct answer.The response B is wrong since it negates the value rather than reverse it.

I am applying for the vacancy of a Front-End Developer at ___ as advertised. With my eight-year experience in front-end development, it is not only my belief but my confidence that I will be far more productive for your team.
My years of experience have provided me with the tools to master different development technologies such as React JS, Vue JS, and Angular. More lately, I have been learning mobile application development through Flutter and React Native by building applications with scalability, high performance, and exciting user engagements. With full-stack development experience that encompasses collaborative project work with cross-functional teams, I can successfully carry out projects from start to completion.
Moreover, I have accomplished other things non-technical, such as a UX/UI designer, who is a person with an eye for detail, and knowledge of what makes a great user experience. It is my pleasure to design interfaces that are not only beautiful but also highly functional and easy to operate. This continues to be the training ground through which I have learned to be effective at communicating design concepts among developers to ensure a final product that aligns with intent.
The opportunity to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to ___ as well as create world-class front-end applications is very tempting to me. I greatly appreciate your review of my application. I’m looking forward to the call when we can talk about how my experiences relate to and your team’s necessary.
