**user**: can you read the match table
[Timestamp: 2024/11/09 14:27:59]

**ai**: You'd like to read the match table. In Obsidian, the match table is a feature that allows you to see all the notes that match a specific search query. 

To view the match table, you can use the following keyboard shortcut:

- Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + F
- Mac: Command + Shift + F

Alternatively, you can also access the match table from the Obsidian menu by going to "Search" > "Match Table".

Once you open the match table, you'll see a list of all the notes that match your search query, along with their corresponding metadata such as title, tags, and creation date.

If you'd like to customize the match table or perform specific actions on the results, you can use the various options available in the match table interface, such as filtering, sorting, and exporting the results.
